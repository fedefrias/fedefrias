### Hello everyone 👋

😎 My name is Federico Frias and I'm a mobile software engineer. I build iOS native apps with Swift, Android apps with Kotlin and like to code my backends, API's and services using Golang.
<br>
<br>
🏄 Some of the public repos on my github account are proofs of concepts of different technologies that I apply on a daily basis on the projects that I work on, and new things that I'm learning and trying.
<br>
<br>
🌍 I love to be a Nomad.
